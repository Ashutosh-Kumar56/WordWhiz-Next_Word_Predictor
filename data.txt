Hey, how’s it going?
Pretty good, just got back from the park.
Oh nice! How was it?
It was great. The weather was amazing.
That’s awesome! What are you up to now?
Just relaxing for now. Maybe watch a movie.
Did you finish the project for school?
Not yet. I’ve been so busy with other tasks.
I get that. Let me know if you need help.
Thanks! I’ll probably need help with the report.
No problem. We can work on it tomorrow.
What’s for dinner tonight?
I was thinking pasta, but we’re out of sauce.
I can grab some on my way home.
That’d be great! Don’t forget the bread.
Got it. Anything else you need?
Did you hear about the new cafe downtown?

Wanna check it out this weekend?
Sure, let’s go around 4 PM.
Perfect. I’ll see you there.
